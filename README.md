# Microprocessor-VHDL
Complete working vhdl code for a simple microprocessor. Includes testbenches.

So this is an assignment I did for CS2022, or Computer Architecture 1. The finished project works, and runs a few basic instructions I wrote into the memory unit, like add, subtract, and increment. I didn't have time to microcode harder instructions like branching, or multicycle instructions like multiplication.
